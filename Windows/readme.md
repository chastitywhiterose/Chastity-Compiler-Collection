# Why a Windows Development Kit?

I do most of my programming on Debian Linux. However, during the past few years, I have managed to refine a system of compiling my programs under Windows so that most users will be able to enjoy them. For example, Chaste Tris, which is on Steam runs under Windows because I expect most gamers to be using.
