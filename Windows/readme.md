# Why a Windows Development Kit?

I do most of my programming on Debian Linux. However, during the past few years, I have managed to refine a system of compiling my programs under Windows so that most users will be able to enjoy them. For example, Chaste Tris, which is on Steam runs under Windows because I expect most gamers to be using.

In addition to the base SDL libraries for version 2 and 3. I have also included extension libraries like SDL_image, SDL_ttf, and SDL2_mixer because sometimes my games used these features.

I have used the versions of these extensions that are compatible with SDL2 because it is all I know how to use at this point. If this changes, I will update.
