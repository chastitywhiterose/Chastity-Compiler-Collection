# Chastity-Compiler-Collection

A place I keep my Windows Development Kit for the C Programming Language and Simple DirectMedia Layer

During the time I was writing my book, Chastity's Code Cookbook, I provided instructions on how to download w64devkit and the development binary libraries for SDL version 2 and 3 on Windows. This repository serves to preserve these instructions and expand on them for a wider audience.
